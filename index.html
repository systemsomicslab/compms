				    <br>MS-DIAL 4/5-alpha raw data parsers now reterive your data as centroid by the vendor's API. So, from this version, please set "centroid" in MS type setting for both MS1 and MS2. <br>
				    <br> MS-DIAL 5-alpha provides an environment for direct infusion MS (DI-MS), ion mobility MS (IM-MS), LC-MS, and LC-IM-MS (except for GC-MS). <br>
					<br> MS-DIAL 5-alpha provides more flexible GUI interface for lipidomics than that of MS-DIAL 4. <br>

						<b>We released version 3 series of MS-DIAL and MS-FINDER. <br></b> Many functions were updated or newly created, and the upgrades will provide more accurate data analysis in addition to faster data processing speed. <br> We hope that our tools are furthor contributed to mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and lipidomics. <br> Importantly, we no longer support the Windows XP OS, and the programs require .Net Framework 4.5 or later. <br> (The .NET framework should have been installed in Windows 7, 8, and 10.)<br> Below is the release note.
					</dd>
					<dd>
						<b>MS-DIAL 3.04 WAS RELEASED. </b><br>
						(3.00 &amp; 3.02 were replaced by 3.04 for minor revision.) <br>
						Major upgrades compared to the previously reported <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4512"><img height="14" width="14" class="imageExlink" src="./static/images/iconLink.png">MS-DIAL version 2 series</a> are summarized.<br><br>
						DATA FORMAT: <br>
						The extensions (*.mtd, *.med, *.pai, *.arf) created in MS-DIAL project are changed to *.*2 (*.mtd2, *.med2, *.pai2, *.arf2). <br>
						There is the compatibility for the previous projects, and all of storages will automatically be reorganized with new formats when you import a previous project.<br> <br>
						FUNCTION: <br>
						Peak character evaluatior: it concatenates the different ion types of one metabolite such as isotope, adduct, and in source fragment ions by the deisotoping, the adduct-ion picking, the chromatogram correlation, and the partial MS1 and MS/MS spectral comparison techniques. <br>
						Ion feature amalgamator: for example, the list of retention time and m/z for monoisotopic ions detected in negative ion mode can be imported to the project of positive ion mode, which is useful for curating the adduct type. <br>
						Labeled metabolite tracking: the function is designed to group the same metabolite ions from partially labelled, fully-labelled, and time-course labeling experiments using carbon (13C), deuterium (D), nitrogen (15N), oxygen (18O), sulfur (34S), or combinations thereof. <br>
						Molecular spectrum network: the known- and unknown metabolite features are mapped to the network based on the spectrum similarity (as used in GNPS and MS2LDA) and/or ion abundance correlation among samples. <br>
						Searching unique product ions and neutral losses: the precursor ions containing user-defined product ions and/or neutral losses can be queried easily. <br> <br>
						MASS SPECTRAL DATABASES: <br>
						MS-DIAL package contains the spectra of MassBank, MassBankEU, GNPS, ReSpect, MetaboBASE, FiehnHILIC, CASMI2016, RIKEN oxidized phospholipids, and RIKEN PlaSMA standard compounds.<br>
						It can be used as the "start-up kit" for untargeted metabolomics. <br>
						Moreover, we also manage the "bio mass spectral database" from plant extracts. (see the detail at <a href="http://plasma.riken.jp/"><img height="14" width="14" class="imageExlink" src="./static/images/iconLink.png">PlaSMA website</a>)<br>
						Now, a total of 29,269 and 17,810 spectral records can be used for positive- and negative ion mode data, respectively. <br>
						For lipidomics, MS-DIAL package contains the theoretical tandem mass spectra for a total of 56 lipid classes (197,527 lipid molecules). <br>
						Dr. Tomas Cajka and Dr. Jeremy Koelmel always help the curations for lipid theoretical mass spectra. <br>
						No update for EI-MS database (yet).<br> <br>
						USER INTERFACE AND OTHERS: <br>
						Creating a graphical user interface is an important part of science at least I think. <br>
						A part of GUI was optimized to check the result of isotope tracking function. <br>
						Moreover, the peak table- and alignment table viewers were developed for the rapid data curation. <br>
						The parallell processing is available, resulting in faster data processing especially for large-scale dataset.
					</dd>
					<dd>
						<b>MS-FINDER 3.02 WAS RELEASED.</b><br>
						(3.00 was replaced by 3.02 for minor revision.) <br>
						Major upgrades compared to the previously reported <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4512"><img height="14" width="14" class="imageExlink" src="./static/images/iconLink.png">MS-FINDER version 2 series</a> are summarized.<br><br>
						DATA FORMAT: <br>
						It accepts two formats, *.msp and *.mat (to import both MS1 and MSMS data). <br>
						All of queries should be recorded in the separated files, and therefore, we created an easy converter "MspToSeparatedMsps" and "MgfToSeparatedMsps" for users. <br> <br>
						FUNCTION: <br> Molecular formula calculator: there was a critical issue in the previous versions where some of formula were not computationally generated. The current program will provide all of putative candidates with parallel computing. <br>
						Metabolite class recommendation (FSEA): new function, fragment set enrichment analysis (FSEA) is officially released to recommend the metabolite classes (ontologies) for unknown spectra. This method does not require any structure databases. <br>
						New ranking method for structure candidates: In addition to the previously reported method including the approval of hydrogen rearrangement rules and reference count, it incorporates the Jaccard index (similarity) between new molecular fingerprint and MS/MS spectra. Both molecular fingerprint and MS/MS spectra is adjusted to a total of 459 binary vector of fragment ontologies. <br>
						Integrated molecular spectrum network: the unknown query is further inspected in the network analysis using the modified Bonanza spectral clustering score (for MS/MS similarity), the Levenshtein distance score (for metabolite ontology similarity), and formula based bioreaction linkage as performed in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685999"><img height="14" width="14" class="imageExlink" src="./static/images/iconLink.png">this papar</a>. <br><br>
						METABOLOME STRUCTURE DATABASES: <br>
						MS-FINDER 3.0 encompasses KNApSAcK (45,852), UNPD (166,995), FooDB (21,943), NANPDB (3,882), STOFF-IDENT (10,231), PlantCyc (3,817), LipidMAPS (34,466), ChEBI (53,746), PubChem biosynthetic pathway (8,285), DrugBank (6,273), SMPDB (1,490), YMDB (1,840), ECMDB (1,342), T3DB (2,499), BMDB (7,232), and the HMDB family including HMDB (95,924), Urine (3,929), Saliva (1,129), Fecal (1,073), CSF (360), and Serum (23,138). The count of structure records is cited in parentheses. Now, the total count of structures is 321,616. An enzymatically expanded in silico structure database MINE (643,307) is also incorporated. We also use the direct parent term of <a href="http://classyfire.wishartlab.com/"><img height="14" width="14" class="imageExlink" src="./static/images/iconLink.png">ClassyFire</a> as the name of metabolite ontology for each structure. <b>Note that the name of metabolite class used in FSEA is not assigned by ClassyFire, but determined manually by our curation team that took into account the MS resolution for structure characterization</b>. <br> <br>
						DATABASE of UNIQUE PRODUCT IONS and NEUTRAL LOSSES for METABOLITE CHARACTERIZATION: <br>
						Unique product ions (PIs) and neutral losses (NLs) for a certain metabolite class have been used for metabolite annotations. For instance, (1) m/z 78.9585 and m/z 96.9595 are used for searching phosphate (PO3-)- and sulfate (HSO4-)-containing metabolites, respectively; (2) neutral losses of 146.0579 (C6H10O4), 162.05282 (C6H10O5), and 176.0321 (C6H8O6) are used for searching metabolites that contain deoxyhexose (dHex), hexose (Hex), and uronic acid (HexA) moieties; (3) aglycones of the flavonol class, e.g. kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin can be searched by their specific m/z values, e.g. 285.0405 (C15H9O6-), 301.0354 (C15H9O7-), and 315.051 (C16H11O7-).<br>
						By means of our computational and manual curations, MS-FINDER 3.0 contains 1,352- and 1,643 product ion queries for positive and negative spectra, respectively. Moreover, 729- and 914 neutral loss queries are also registered. The m/z and neutral loss query contains the information of mass, formula candidates, ontology candidates, and (substructure) InChIKey candidates.
